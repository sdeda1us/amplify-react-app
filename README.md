#Amplify React Music Library Test

##Description
### Duration: Weekend - 10 hours

This application is a proof of concept for uploading and storing mp3 files on Amazon AWS for another project I am working on. As part of the project, I was tasked with picking one task that I did not know very much about and trying to learn as much as I could about it in one weekend.  

The application is a React frontend witha full Amazon Web Services backend supporting it. The app uses AWS Cognito for login management, AWS S3 to host the page, an AWS S3 bucket to store the files, and an Amazon DynamoDB graphQL noSQL database to handle the metadata for each audio file.  

One of the greatest challenges was correctly aligning all of the versions of dependencies between NPM and Amplify so that they would all work with one another.
